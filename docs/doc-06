## .Xresources and Pywal

This fork of speedwm has .Xresources support thanks to the .Xresources patch. It also has pywal support (tool which grabs colors based on your wallpaper).

Colors do not reload automatically though, you must reload them manually. Use a signal for this (See list of signals above) or simply 'libspeedwm --perform core_wm_reload'.

To use .Xresources, make sure 'xrdb' is installed. If a .xinitrc is used, add 'xrdb /path/to/.Xresources/file' before 'speedwm'. If a .Xresources file is not used, add it to ~/.config/speedwm/autostart.sh instead.

If you don't want to define the options manually, there is an example .Xresources file containing speedwm default settings in docs/example.Xresources. You can copy this somewhere or you can simply '< docs/example.Xresources >> ~/.Xresources' to append the speedwm options to your .Xresources file.

The magic of .Xresources is that it is a universal configuration file. While you *can* use the col.value values, you can also use traditional colors 0 through 15 as well. These colors take priority over regular speedwm colors. This is so that speedwm is compatible with Pywal and more general/mainstream .Xresources configurations.

Below is a list of all .Xresources values you can define.

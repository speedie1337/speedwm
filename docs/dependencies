## Dependencies

These are absolutely necessary, speedwm will NOT compile without them
- libxft
- pango
- libXinerama
  - Can be disabled through editing toggle.mk if you're not interested in multiple monitors.
- imlib2
  - Tag previews, Window icons. Can be disabled through editing toggle.mk and toggle.h if you don't want these features.
- yajl
  - Required for the IPC patch. If the IPC patch is disabled, you do not need this.
- tcc
  - Very minimal C compiler that speedwm uses to speed up compile times. If you don't want this dependency, edit host.mk and set CC to 'cc' (or what you prefer).

## Features

These are necessary for certain features and keybinds.
If you want to use an alternative, change it in options.h and/or keybinds.h and mouse.h.

- dmenu
  - NOTE: dmenu is required for most scripts included with this build of speedwm. My build is required for proper Pywal support.
- picom
  - Optional but speedwm looks sort of ugly without a compositor.
- xrdb (Install if you want .Xresources support)
- pywal (Install if you want pywal support. Requires swal (the default way to set wallpapers) or a tool that supports the correct signal for instant reloading)
- j4-dmenu-desktop
  - Required for dmenu desktop entries..
  
## Software

This build of speedwm comes with binds for software. 
You can add, change and remove keybinds by editing 'keybinds.h' and running 'make clean install'.

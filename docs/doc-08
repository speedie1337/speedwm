## Status bar

speedwm has a status bar. It's the right part of the bar. It supports Pango, status2d and statuscmd markup as well as regular plain text and colored emojis or glyphs. To override this status, you can use the 'speedwm -s <status>' command.

Bundled with speedwm is a fork of dwmblocks. dwmblocks is a dwm status bar that handles this all for you through a block system. This fork has been integrated into the Makefile and is (by default) installed when speedwm is compiled. The status bar can be configured in the status.c and status.h and clickability can be configured in statusbar.h.

By default the status bar runs modules that are also bundled with speedwm (see modules/ directory). To configure these modules, you can edit ~/.config/speedwm/statusrc which should be created when a module runs.

The bundled status bar is autostarted by speedwm if it is installed. If you want to use your own status bar, comment out 'USESTATUS' in toggle.mk and remove /usr/bin/status if speedwm has been installed previously. Then simply start the status bar through autostart.h, ~/.config/speedwm/autostart.sh or .xinitrc if you are using that.

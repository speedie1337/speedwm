## Additional note on autostart

If you wish to add autostart entries without recompiling, consider using $HOME/.config/speedwm/autostart.sh. This is a path added to autostart.h and you can fill it with anything you want.

Do note that it will NOT just run once. It will run every time you restart and start speedwm (restart signals count as well, color reloads do not).
To get around this, you may wrap stuff in a function in the script and have some way of checking if it has ran before such as pgrep. If it hasn't, call the function.
